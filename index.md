## Introduction

Hello! My name is **Justin Nguyen**, and I am a **junior** studying **computer science**. During my free time, I enjoy running, surfing, watching tv/movies, or hanging out with friends. If you want to chat, feel free to add me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/justnguyen1/)!

Here is a quote that I like:

> Comparison is the thief of joy.

## Programming

My favorite line of code to write: 

`System.out.println("Hello World");`
